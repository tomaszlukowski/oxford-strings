  <h1>String Group Junior Seminar</h1>

  <p>
    The Oxford string theory group has its informal lunchtime sessions
    at 12 o'clock each Wednesday during term time, in L5 (or L3) on
    the mezzanine floor of the Andrew Wiles building. This is a chance
    to get together once a week to discuss topics of interest in an
    informal way, and hopefully learn from each other. Unfortunately,
    no food is allowed in the seminar room, but those who want may
    continue discussions over lunch at the mezzanine cafeteria after
    the seminar.
  </p>

  <p>
    Below is the list of people who have agreed to lead discussions on
    given weeks, and the corresponding topics. If you wish to suggest
    a topic you would like to know more about, or volunteer to present
    something, contact Carolina, Chuang, Ricardo or Susama. Remember
    that we want to keep these sessions informal and
    discussional. Everything should be done on the whiteboard or
    verbally (no slides!), and should assume as little prior knowledge
    as is reasonable.
  </p>
